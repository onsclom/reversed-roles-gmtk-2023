# idea

- player is a ball with cute programmatic eyes
- you rotate the level aroudn player (basically controling gravity)
- "spacebar" might rotate by 180, allowing for hovering like flappy bird manuevers?!

- probably level based?

- let's just code base mechanic and see how it feels?

- camera should probably be locked to player, but background should give sense of movement
- maybe grid of dots for background?

- make particles come out of player that are global!

- lospec color schemes are godlike! REMEMBer this..
- maybe i dynamically change colorscheme for levels?!!?!? yessss

=================

X lets animation those eyes with springs
X then lets get that traingle background going (prob on cpu)
~ then make starting area that teaches controls and looks decent!!!

- really simple first spiral level to teach left and right?
- then we need a level that forces flip somehow..

- what if blocks appear/disappear in different gravity flips?!

- IT NEEDS NICE PASTEL MINAMLISTIC LOSPEC COLOR THEME
- set animation speed lower on triangles further away!

- sounds on fast wall bounces (maybe char blinks?)
- particle effect on death

- goal needs to be particle black hole thing!

- needs time and deaths at end

LEVEL / MECHANIC IDEAS:

- red lava blocks that kill on touch!
- moving red blocks
- cannon that aims and shoots!
- speed boosts?
- areas that trap your gravity?
