# idea

- player is a ball with cute programmatic eyes
- you rotate the level aroudn player (basically controling gravity)
- "spacebar" might rotate by 180, allowing for hovering like flappy bird manuevers?!

- probably level based?

- let's just code base mechanic and see how it feels?

- camera should probably be locked to player, but background should give sense of movement
- maybe grid of dots for background?

- make particles come out of player that are global!

- lospec color schemes are godlike! REMEMBer this..
- maybe i dynamically change colorscheme for levels?!!?!? yessss
